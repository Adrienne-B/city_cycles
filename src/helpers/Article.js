            Some of the densely covered trails are damp, but still rideable. <br/>
            This is a fun flowy trail! It has a number of blind LH corners so <br/>
            whistle or use a bell so you can alert anyone coming the <br />  opposite way.

            Built specifically for mountain bikes, a flow trail emphasizes <br/> speed
            and rhythm, featuring berms, rollers, jumps and other <br />
            features that are designed in a way that uses the riderâ€™s <br/>
             momentum to minimize
            pedaling and braking (think downhill <br /> pump track). This trail is 
            known for its flow. Having gotten that <br />
             out of the way, the Mana Road ride is absolutely beautiful and <br />
              worth the ride.

            More info coming soon..Ridgeline is a crown jewel of Dupont State <br /> Recreational Forest. 
            Probably not best to ride. Amazing views of Castle valley are afforded after 50 meters
            of riding. Very loose and dry. Few <br />  sections rutted out but great experience for my first ride there!

            The flowiest trails of the mountain! There are actually three trails <br />  which make up the 
            loop: Horse Creek-Cattle Creek-Lower Twin Lake. <br /> Hymasa is a bit easier, so if you are
            unsure of your skill, start there, <br /> and then climb back up Hymasa to do Captain Ahab. 
            The exposed <br /> rock section near the bottom is a highlight of the trail giving the <br /> exposed 
            granite slabs of Squamish a run for their money. Fun!
